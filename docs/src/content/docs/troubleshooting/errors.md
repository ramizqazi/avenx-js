Avenx-JS uses structured error codes starting with `AVX_C` for compiler errors and `AVX_R` for runtime issues.

## Compiler Codes (`AVX_C*`)

| Code | Default Message | Cause & Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[AVX_C01]` | Could not create dist directory at "{dir}". | **Cause:** Write permission failure.<br />**Resolution:** Adjust your operating system directory write permissions. |
| `[AVX_C02]` | "src" directory not found. | **Cause:** Running the build command outside of an Avenx project root.<br />**Resolution:** Run `npx avenx init` to set up the workspace. |

## Runtime Codes (`AVX_R*`)

| Code | Default Message | Cause & Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[AVX_R01]` | Mount target selector "{selector}" was not found in the DOM. | **Cause:** Missing container tag in `index.html`.<br />**Resolution:** Verify your index file has a matching tag like `<div id="app"></div>`. |
| `[AVX_R02]` | Page "{name}" is not registered. | **Cause:** Mapping route patterns to non-existent or un-compiled pages.<br />**Resolution:** Check spelling and verify page JS exists inside `src/pages/`. |
| `[AVX_R03]` | Component "{name}" is not registered. | **Cause:** Declaring a custom component tag (e.g. `<MyButton />`) without registering it.<br />**Resolution:** Import and register it inside `src/main.app.js`. |
| `[AVX_R04]` | Circular dependency detected in computed property "{name}". | **Cause:** Computed getters reference themselves directly or indirectly.<br />**Resolution:** Refactor computed expressions so they do not reference their own keys. |
| `[AVX_R05]` | Failed to evaluate computed property "{name}". | **Cause:** Unhandled exceptions inside custom getter scripts.<br />**Resolution:** Review expression syntax and ensure referenced states are defined. |
| `[AVX_R06]` | Navigation guard denied transition. | **Cause:** A guard returned false (Expected behavior for access controls). |
| `[AVX_R07]` | Navigation guard threw an error. | **Cause:** Route guard evaluations failed.<br />**Resolution:** Wrap asynchronous fetches in try/catch blocks. |
| `[AVX_R08]` | Failed to render interpolation expression "{expr}". | **Cause:** Accessing properties on undefined or null properties.<br />**Resolution:** Guard properties in template: `{{ state.user ? state.user.name : '' }}`. |
| `[AVX_R09]` | Event handler execution failed. | **Cause:** Unhandled exceptions in event listener actions.<br />**Resolution:** Verify method declarations match event expressions. |
| `[AVX_R10]` | Bridge "{name}" already exists. | **Cause:** Duplicate registrations.<br />**Resolution:** Assign unique names to bridges. |
