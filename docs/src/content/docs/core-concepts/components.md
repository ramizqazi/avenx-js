In Avenx-JS, a component is defined by two companion files in the same directory: `<name>.component.js` (logic and template) and `<name>.component.css` (styles).

## JavaScript File (`.component.js`)

The component file contains configuration tags at the top and the HTML template at the bottom. The configuration tags are parsed at compile-time and stripped out before outputting class declarations.

- `<state key="val" />` - Declares the component's reactive local properties. Attributes are coerced to their corresponding JS types (numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects).

- `<computed name="computedName" value="expression" />` - Defines computed getters. The value attribute accepts stringified JS expressions.

- `<action name="methodName"> ... </action>` - Defines actions (methods) that have access to the component's state, computed attributes, and bridges in their execution scope.

```html
<!-- src/components/greet/greet.component.js -->
<state username="Guest" isLoggedIn="false" />

<computed name="greeting" value="isLoggedIn ? 'Welcome back, ' + username : 'Hello, Guest!'" />

<action name="login">
    state.username = "Jane Doe";
    state.isLoggedIn = true;
</action>

<div class="greet-box">
    <h3>{{ greeting }}</h3>
    <button @click="login()">Log In</button>
</div>
```
