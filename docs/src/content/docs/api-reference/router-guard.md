## AvenxGuard

Route guards extend `AvenxGuard`. Override the following method to implement route access validation:

### `canActivate(to, from)`

Called before navigating to a route.

| Param | Properties | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `to` | `hash, page, params` | Target route details. |
| `from` | `hash, page, params` | Current route details (or null if initial load). |

**Returns:** `boolean` (true to allow, false to deny) or `string` (a redirect hash like `'#/login'`).
